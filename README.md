# Shivang Kumar Dubey

I’m interested in systems that enforce rules —  
and what happens when those rules are misunderstood.

Most of my learning right now revolves around  
protocols, transactions, and software that has no room for ambiguity.

### Current Focus

- Bitcoin protocol & node interaction  
- Transaction construction, fees, and validation  
- Systems programming fundamentals (Rust mindset)  
- Learning by building small, real, breakable systems

### Philosophy

I don’t optimize for speed.  
I optimize for **understanding**.

Abstractions are useful —  
but only after you know what they’re hiding.

This profile is not a highlight reel.  
It’s a trail of work-in-progress.
