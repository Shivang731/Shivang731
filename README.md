# Shivang Kumar Dubey

I’m interested in systems that enforce rules —  
and what happens when those rules are misunderstood.

I spend most days learning how protocols, transactions,
and real software systems behave under pressure.

Some days, you’ll catch me reading manhwa or watching anime.
Balance matters.

### Current Focus

- Bitcoin protocol & node interaction  
- Transaction construction, fees, and validation  
- Systems-level thinking (learning Rust the hard way)  
- Backend fundamentals and problem-solving  

I’m learning with one clear goal in mind:  
to become good enough that **getting hired becomes inevitable**.

### Philosophy

I don’t optimize for speed.  
I optimize for **understanding**.

Abstractions are useful —  
but only after you know what they’re hiding.

This profile isn’t a highlight reel.  
It’s a trail of work-in-progress.

### Outside Code

- Manhwa when I need perspective  
- Anime when I need to slow down  
- Long walks when something doesn’t click  

Not everything productive looks like work.
